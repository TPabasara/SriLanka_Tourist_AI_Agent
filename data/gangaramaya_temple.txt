Overview and Description: The Gangaramaya Temple is one of Colombo's most iconic and fascinating Buddhist temples.
                          It is more than just a place of worship; it functions as a beacon for the community, a vocational training institute, and a "living museum".
                          Its architecture is a famously eclectic "electric mix" of Sri Lankan, Thai, Indian, and Chinese styles, reflecting its role as an international institute.
                          The complex is a sprawling collection of imposing buildings, a library, and a densely packed museum.
Historical and Cultural Significance: The temple was started in the late 19th century by the renowned scholar monk Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Nayaka Thera.
                                    It expanded from a small shrine into the major institute it is today.
                                    The temple is famous for its annual "Nawam Maha Perahera," a grand procession with elephants, dancers, and drummers that pays homage to sacred relics.
                                    Main Attractions and Activities: The Treasure Trove Museum: The temple's most distinguishing feature is its vast, eclectic museum, which contains innumerable statues of Buddha and Hindu deities, antiques, rare manuscripts, and a famous collection of vintage automobiles, including classic Rolls-Royces and Sri Lanka's first Mercedes-Benz.
                                    Seema Malaka: The temple complex includes the Seema Malaka, a serene "floating temple" designed by Geoffrey Bawa on the nearby Beira Lake, used for meditation.
